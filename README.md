# ConvexHull_Visualization
ConvexHull_Visualization is implementation of 5 different Convex hull techniques build with JavaFX. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all given points. This project serves as an educational tool to visualize the step-by-step construction of the convex hull.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas:** Add points to the canvas by clicking, and watch as the convex hull is dynamically computed and displayed.
- **Graham's Scan Algorithm:** The convex hull is calculated using Graham's Scan algorithm, starting from the point with the lowest y-coordinate.
- **BruteForce Technique:** This technique calculates all the points with all the point and create a hull.
- **Jarvis_March Algorithm:** The convex Hull is calculated using Jarvis March Alogirthm , starting from left-most point.
- **Quick-Elimination Algorithm:** The convex Hull is calcuated using Quick Elimination Algorithm , starting by choosing a quadrilateral Q or rectangle R with 4 points as corners.
- **Quick-Hull Algorthm:** The convex Hull is calculated using QuickHull Algorithm , starting by taking the maximum x-coordinate.
- **Animation:** The construction of the convex hull is animated, providing a clear and engaging visualization of the algorithm.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Click on the canvas to add points interactively.
